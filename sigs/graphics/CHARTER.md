# SIG Graphics 

## Goal

Facilitate community-contributed graphics, 3D and geometric components to [tensorflow/graphics](http://github.com/tensorflow/graphics), and enable researchers in the differentiable 3D, differentiable computer graphics, and neural rendering fields.

## Objectives

* Foster research on differentiable 3D, differentiable computer graphics and neural rendering
* Create a surface of collaboration for expert practitioners and enthusiasts excited to push the state-of-the-art in those areas.  
* Build standard structures and implementations for 3D and graphics components   
* Provide a central place to contribute and access tooling and implementations for the computer vision, computer graphics communities
* Host academic work in a sub-folder of the repository, where contributors can have their work available to the public and integrated with the rest of the TensorFlow Graphics repository. 
* Make it easier for research results to be implemented in the industry.

## Membership

We encourage any researchers and developers working in the computer graphics and computer vision communities to participate in this SIG. Whether you are conducting academic research or building industry applications in this space, we welcome your feedback on and contributions to Tensorflow Graphics’ components and central tooling, and are eager to hear about any downstream research results and implementations of our code. 
We have multiple channels for participation, and publicly archive discussions in graphics@ and graphics-dev@:

* graphics@tensorflow.org -- our general mailing list that all are welcome to join
* graphics-dev@tensorflow.org -- mailing list for active contributors to TF Graphics tooling
* graphics-core@tensorflow.org -- mailing list for core SIG leaders in academia
