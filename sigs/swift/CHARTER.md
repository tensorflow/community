# SIG Swift

## Objective

The purpose of this special interest group is to host design reviews; discuss upcoming API changes; share the project roadmap; and encourage collaboration in the Swift for TensorFlow (S4TF) open-source community. Members of the S4TF community are encouraged to attend the weekly design sessions, and to share feedback on the project mailing list.

## Membership

Anyone involved in or interested in Swift for TensorFlow is welcome to join the group. To participate, please join the mailing list (swift@tensorflow.org) at the link listed below. Archives of the mailing list will be publicly accessible via the Google Group.

## Resources

* Mailing list: [swift@tensorflow.org](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/swift)
* Github repo: [tensorflow/swift](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift)

## Collaboration

We plan to have a one hour weekly meeting with a public Google Video Conference for S4TF-related discussion. Every subscriber to the swift@tensorflow.org mailing list will be invited. We will publish a document for all interested members to add topics. The main goals of these meetings will include, but not be restricted to:

1. Discussion and review of language decision and API changes.
2. Roadmap discussions.
3. Issues, bugs, and compatibility concerns.
4. Community contributions and ways to get involved.
