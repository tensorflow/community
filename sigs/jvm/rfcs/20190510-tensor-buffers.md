## Objective

Simplify and improve performances of creating tensors in Java by writing and reading 
directly to/from their allocated native buffers, in respect to their internal format.

## Motivation

Currently, the easiest way to create tensors in Java is by invoking one of the
factory methods exposed by the [`Tensors`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/Tensors.java)
class. While their signatures are elegant, by accepting concrete Java objects and 
multi-dimensional arrays, they make heavy use of reflection techniques to extract 
the shape and the size of the tensors to allocate. This results in poor performances,
as discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/8244).

Reading tensor data uses a [similar approach](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c23fd17c3781b21bd3309faa13fad58472c78e93/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/Tensor.java#L449) and faces also performances issues. 
In addition, it requires in some cases that the user allocates a new buffer on the heap
into which the tensor data is copied (see [`writeTo()`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/c23fd17c3781b21bd3309faa13fad58472c78e93/tensorflow/java/src/main/java/org/tensorflow/Tensor.java#L483) methods, for example), which is not convenient when dealing
with large tensors.

Now that eager execution environment is (almost) supported by the Java client, it is imperative that the 
I/O operations between the tensor buffers and the JVM are efficient enough to let the users peek at and, 
in some situation, modify their data without a important performance hit.

## Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Factors to consider include:

* performance implications
* dependencies
* maintenance
* platforms and environments impacted (e.g. hardware, cloud, other software
  ecosystems)
* [compatibility](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/version_compat)
* how will this change impact users, and how will that be managed?

## Detailed Design

This section is optional. Elaborate on details if they’re important to
understanding the design, but would make it hard to read the proposal section
above.
