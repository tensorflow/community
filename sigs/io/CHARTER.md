# SIG IO - TensorFlow data formats and file systems group

## Objective

TensorFlow has built-in support for accessing a small set of file systems and
data formats. This SIG aims to add support for more file systems and file
formats.

The group evaluates proposals and designs in this area and maintains code in the
`tensorflow/io` repository. The repository should contain only subclasses of
`tf.data.Dataset` and TensorFlow filesystems, as well as supporting code.

## Membership

Everybody with an interest in improving TensorFlow interoperability is welcome
to join the SIG. To participate, request an invitation to join the mailing list.
Archives of the mailing list are publicly accessible.
