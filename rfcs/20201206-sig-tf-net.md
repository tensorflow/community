## Objective

We propose to create a Tensorflow SIG to bring the technology to the Microsoft .NET framework and apply it to .NET based applications. This document outlines the context goals, and engagement plan for the proposed Special Interest Group.

## Context

**.NET** is a free and open-source, managed computer software framework for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems. It's been used by 6 million .NET developers and there are millions of apps built on it from traditional industry form application to web services and machine learning. With [TensorFlow .NET binding](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET) maintained by [SciSharp STACK](http://scisharpstack.org/) community, C# and F# developers can now use Deep Learning with TensorFlow in their .NET applications. TensorFlow.NET is the prospect framework for machine learning in .NET with fast user growth (250k [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TensorFlow.NET/) total downloads). TensorFlow .NET binding can be used to develop, train and deploy models. SciSharp STACK has more than 30+ contributors on GitHub which include many passionate contributors who have been active participants in the TensorFlow.NET. We want to accelerate the community involvement in the project to help continue meet the needs and help drive new directions for the project. 

## Goals & Objectives

We welcome community contributions on any aspect of TensorFlow.NET, but the SIG will be focused on 
the following goals:

- Help and expand the influence of the TensorFlow ecosystem in the .NET ecosystem.
- Making TensorFlow .NET binding cover as many APIs as possible.
- Adding complete Keras API support.
- Adding support for newer models and application areas including NLP and CV.
- Training visualization, support TensorBoard.
- Support the different devices with CPU, TPU, GPU and Apple M1 chip.
- Keep the .NET version as close as possible to the actual python code.

## Membership

We encourage any developer who is working in the combination of AI/ ML and web/ windows form/ [xamarian](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin)/ [unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpZP_TWhq04) applications to join and participate in the activities of the SIG. Whether you are working on advancing the platform, prototyping or building specific applications, or authoring new libraries, 
we welcome your feedback on and contributions to TensorFlow .NET and its tooling. 

We have multiple channels for participation, and publicly archive discussions in our user group and 
announcements mailing lists:

- tfnet@tensorflow.org -- our general mailing list that all are welcome to join ([archive group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/tfnet))
- tfnet-announce@tensorflow.org -- Announcement only mailing list for TF.net community ([archive group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/tfnet-announce))

We will create a new mailing list for TensorFlow.net SIG members. 

### Other Resources 
- Repository: https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET/
- Documentation: https://tensorflownet.readthedocs.io/

## Organization and Governance
SIG project leads will be added to a SIG TF.net maintainers team on GitHub to streamline their contributions to tensorflow/tfnet. As specific ideas and workflow development, we will explore creating new, community-owned repos that the SIG will drive.
